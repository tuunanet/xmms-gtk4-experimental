# Release process

XMMS Classic uses deliberate, manually tested releases. Merging a pull request
to `main` runs CI but does not publish a release. Short-lived `release/*`
branches produce release candidates, while immutable annotated `v*` tags are
the only source of official GitHub Releases.

Official releases are initially created as drafts. Publishing the draft remains
a manual maintainer decision after its notes and artifacts have been reviewed.

## Release lifecycle

pull requests -> main -> release/VERSION -> candidate artifact -> manual tests

                              annotated vVERSION tag on main <-+
                                                               |
                                              draft GitHub Release

                                              tested DEB/RPM packages
                                                               |
                                                 manual publication
```

## 1. Prepare the release branch

Choose a SemVer `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version and create a short-lived branch from
an up-to-date `main`:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git switch -c release/1.3.1
```

Prepare a release commit that:

1. changes the version in `configure.in` (`AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE`);
2. applies the same version to the shipped generated `configure` script;
3. applies the same version to the shipped generated `xmms.spec` file;
4. changes `CHANGELOG.md`'s `[Unreleased]` content into a dated
   `[VERSION]` entry and adds a new empty `[Unreleased]` section; and
5. contains no unrelated behavior changes.

The legacy Autotools stack cannot currently be regenerated unchanged with
modern `autoreconf`. Update the narrowly scoped generated version fields rather
than committing a broad Autotools regeneration.

Validate the release metadata locally:

```sh
tools/check-release-version.sh 1.3.1
```

This rejects non-SemVer versions, disagreement between source and generated
package metadata, missing changelog entries, and duplicate version headings.
Submit the release preparation through the normal pull-request and CI process.
Normal CI invokes `make deb`, so Debian packaging regressions must pass before
candidate assembly begins.

## 2. Build and test a candidate

Open **Actions -> Release candidate -> Run workflow** in GitHub. Select the
`release/1.3.1` branch and enter `1.3.1` as the version.

The workflow accepts only `release/*` branches. It runs:

- configuration and compilation;
- the complete Xvfb-backed `make check` suite;
- `make distcheck` from the source distribution; and
- `make deb`, followed by installation and smoke testing of both packages.

A successful run uploads a 30-day workflow artifact containing:

- `xmms-1.3.1.tar.gz`;
- Ubuntu 24.04 `xmms` and `libxmms-dev` DEBs;
- `SHA256SUMS` covering the source archive and both DEBs;
- `release-notes.md`, extracted from the versioned changelog entry; and
- `RELEASE-METADATA.txt`, identifying the candidate commit and workflow run.

Download that workflow artifact and verify it before testing:

```sh
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS
tar -xzf xmms-1.3.1.tar.gz
sudo apt install './xmms_1.3.1-1~ubuntu24.04_amd64.deb' \
  './libxmms-dev_1.3.1-1~ubuntu24.04_amd64.deb'
```

Manual testing should use the candidate archive rather than an unrelated local
checkout. At minimum, test clean configuration and compilation, startup, MP3
playback and seeking, volume and balance, popup menus, playlist operations, and
preferences. Exercise relevant Linux/BSD and audio/display environments when
available. Record the candidate commit and results in the release pull request.

If testing finds a defect, fix it through a reviewed change, update both the
release branch and `main` as appropriate, then build a new candidate. Do not
reuse an older artifact after the candidate commit changes.

## 3. Finalize and tag

After candidate approval, merge the release preparation into `main` and wait
for required CI to pass. Create an annotated tag on the resulting `main`
commit:

```sh
git switch main
git pull --ff-only
git tag -a v1.3.1 -m "XMMS Classic 1.3.1"
git push origin v1.3.1
```

A release tag must:

- use the exact `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` form;
- be annotated rather than lightweight;
- point to a commit contained in `main`;
- match `configure.in`, `configure`, and `xmms.spec`; and
- have exactly one non-empty `CHANGELOG.md` release entry.

The tag workflow rebuilds and retests the tagged source with read-only
permissions. Only after those checks succeed does a separate least-privilege
job receive `contents: write` permission and create the draft GitHub Release.
The draft receives the distchecked source archive, `SHA256SUMS`, and release
notes extracted from the matching changelog entry.

## 4. Build native packages

While the official release is still a draft, manually run **Package release**
from `main` with the release's SemVer version. The workflow downloads and
verifies the draft's source archive rather than rebuilding from a moving
branch. It then:

- builds `xmms` and `libxmms-dev` DEBs on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS;
- builds `xmms` and `xmms-devel` RPMs inside Fedora 42;
- runs the full Xvfb-backed tests during both native package builds;
- inspects package metadata and expected files;
- installs both runtime and development packages in their clean build
  environments and checks `xmms --version`;
- normalizes DEB filenames for GitHub release assets; and
- creates `PACKAGES-SHA256SUMS` and `PACKAGE-METADATA.txt` before attaching the
  files to the unpublished draft.

Only draft validation and attachment jobs receive `contents: write` permission,
because unpublished draft releases and their assets are hidden from read-only
workflow tokens. The attachment job requires an unpublished, stable draft and
refuses to replace any existing release asset.
A package correction must therefore happen before publication or use an
incremented application patch release rather than silently changing published
bytes.

These packages target x86-64 Ubuntu 24.04 and Fedora 42. A native package is not
claimed to support unrelated distributions merely because they use the same
archive format.

## 5. Review and publish

Before publishing the draft in GitHub:

1. confirm the tag and displayed version;
2. inspect the extracted release notes;
3. download the source archive and verify `SHA256SUMS`;
4. download the native packages and verify `PACKAGES-SHA256SUMS`;
5. confirm both release workflows succeeded for the tagged commit and packaging
   recipes on `main`; and
6. perform any final smoke test required for the release.

Then publish the complete draft manually. With immutable releases enabled,
publication permanently locks its tag, notes, and all source and package
assets. Delete the short-lived release branch after publication. Never move,
delete, or recreate a published version tag; prepare a new patch release
instead.

Rerunning a failed tag workflow may update an existing draft and replace its
source assets. The release workflow refuses to modify a published release, and
the package workflow never replaces package assets.

## Rollback and hotfixes

A GitHub Release is immutable release history, not a deployment that can be
silently rolled back. If a published artifact is defective:

1. mark the affected release clearly in its notes if users must avoid it;
2. branch from the appropriate maintained commit;
3. prepare and test a new patch version; and
4. publish a new tag and release through the same process.

Do not replace assets on an already published release with different bytes.

## Implementation references

The workflows follow GitHub's documented mechanisms for
[manual workflow dispatch](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/manually-run-a-workflow),
[tag push filters](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflows-and-actions/workflow-syntax#onpushbranchestagsbranches-ignoretags-ignore),
and least-privilege
[`GITHUB_TOKEN` permissions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/automatic-token-authentication#modifying-the-permissions-for-the-github_token).
Draft creation uses the official
[`gh release create`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_create) command
with `--verify-tag` so automation cannot silently create a missing tag. Native
package attachment uses the documented
[`gh release upload`](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_release_upload) command
without `--clobber`, after checking every asset name while the release remains
a draft. Package recipes follow
the official [Debian maintainer
reference](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debmake-doc/) and [Fedora
packaging guidelines](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/).
