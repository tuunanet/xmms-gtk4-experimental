# Contributing to XMMS GTK4 Experimental

Thank you for helping preserve XMMS. Changes should keep the classic XMMS
experience intact while improving compatibility, reliability, security, or
maintainability on current systems.

## Before starting

- Search [existing issues](https://github.com/tuunanet/xmms-gtk4-experimental/issues).
- For a substantial behavior change, open an issue before writing code.
- Keep pull requests focused; avoid mixing formatting, refactoring, and behavior
  changes.

## Build and test

Install a C toolchain, `pkg-config`, GTK2/GLib2 development packages, and zlib.
ALSA, OpenGL, Vorbis, and MikMod development packages enable their respective
plugins. See the [README](README.md#requirements) for details.

```sh
./configure --disable-esd
make -j"$(nproc)"
make check
```

`make check` runs the regression tests. The file-browser tests require an X11
display; in a headless environment, run them through Xvfb:

```sh
xvfb-run --auto-servernum make check
```

On Ubuntu 24.04 or a compatible Debian build environment, build the same
runtime and development packages checked by CI with:

```sh
make deb
```

This creates `deb-artifacts/*.deb`, runs the package test suite, and checks the
packaged MP3 plugin linkage. It never installs dependencies or elevates
privileges; required build dependencies must already be installed.

If a change affects UI or audio behavior, also describe the manual runtime
testing performed in the pull request.

## C static analysis

Install Cppcheck, then run the same regression gate used by CI:

```sh
sudo apt-get install cppcheck
make lint
```

Ubuntu 24.04's packaged Cppcheck is the authoritative CI environment. The gate
analyzes maintained C sources and headers while excluding generated `intl/`
sources. It enables defect-oriented warning, performance, and portability
checks rather than style-only diagnostics.

Fix new findings whenever practical. If a finding is confirmed as existing,
intentional, or a false positive, add only a narrow
`diagnostic-id:path:line` entry to the suppression baseline at
`tools/cppcheck-suppressions.txt`, explain it in the pull request, and rerun
`make lint`. Do not add project-wide diagnostic suppressions or refresh the
baseline merely to make CI green. Baseline changes must receive the same review
as source changes.

Pull requests that only touch documentation and other non-build metadata still
report the required `build-and-test` check, but CI skips the full configure,
build, test, distcheck, and Debian package steps. Skipped paths currently
include `docs/**`, top-level prose (`README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `CONTRIBUTORS.md`, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`,
`COPYING`, `ABOUT-NLS`), editor/VCS metadata (`.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`,
`.editorconfig`), and GitHub issue/PR templates under `.github/` (workflow
YAML is **not** skipped). Any other path keeps the full suite.

Pushing new commits while a run is in progress cancels the previous run on the
same ref (`cancel-in-progress`). The cancelled run’s required gate fails with
`cancelled`; that is expected—only the latest commit’s checks matter for merge.

## Local dual-agent review

Maintainers using Pi can run the project-local dual-blind review gate before a
pull request. Start Pi from a trusted checkout; Pi installs the exact package
version declared in `.pi/settings.json` into the ignored `.pi/npm/` cache.
Review the package source before approving a new version.

After `audit-code` passes, invoke:

```text
/dual-review
```

Pi asks for explicit approval before running the repository-controlled
`xmms-reviewer-a` and `xmms-reviewer-b` roles. The prompt starts both isolated
reviewers in parallel with identical briefs and passes only when both report
zero must-fix findings and scores of at least 94. Do not enable unconfirmed
project agents or commit package caches, credentials, sessions, or reports.

The static wiring contract runs through `make check`. Model-backed review stays
local and interactive; CI does not receive model credentials.

## Project conventions

- Follow the style of the surrounding C code; do not reformat unrelated lines.
- Add a regression test for bug fixes when practical.
- Treat compiler and Cppcheck warnings as defects. Do not silence a diagnostic
  without explaining why it is safe.
- Add user-visible changes to the `Unreleased` section of
  [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).
- Update documentation in the same pull request as the behavior it describes.
- Use focused commit messages such as `fix: restore playback after ALSA seek`.

## Autotools files

This repository ships generated Autotools files so users can build directly
from a checkout without bootstrapping old macro dependencies. The build system
predates current Autoconf and Automake releases and cannot yet be regenerated
unchanged by a modern `autoreconf`.

When modifying build metadata:

- update the authoritative `.am` or `.in` source;
- update its shipped generated counterpart in the same pull request; and
- verify both a clean `./configure && make` build and `make distcheck`.

Do not run `autoreconf --force --install` and commit its broad generated diff
unless the pull request is specifically migrating the Autotools stack.

## Releases

Merges to `main` are not automatically published. Maintainers collect changes,
build manually tested candidates from short-lived `release/*` branches, and
publish official releases from annotated version tags. See the
[release process](docs/releases.md) for the complete checklist.

## Pull requests

A pull request should explain:

- what problem it solves;
- why the chosen approach fits this preservation-focused fork;
- how it was tested; and
- any compatibility or packaging impact.
